    <h2>About ooTech DTES</h2>
    ooTech DTES based on <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server>">o4oren's</a> Ad Hoc Email Server with the purpose of serving the community on a freeway.<br>
    ooTech DTES is a next generation free temporary email address service.<br>
    ooTech DTES focuses on a modern UI, high fidelity, mobile friendliness, an easy to use <a href="/help/api">API</a> and <a heref="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server>">freely available code</a>.<br>
    ooTech DTES was born of out of necessity, and was built as a weekend project by Oren Geva.<br>
    It is not a business, and has no profit goals. If ads are included in the service it is to help maintaining this service free.<br>

    ooTech DTES was built as a MEAN stack, using <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> on top of some awesome open source packages. Check out the github repo for a complete list and licenses.<br>
    We would, however, like to mention one of those projects - <a href="https://nodemailer.com/about/">Nodemailer</a> by Andris Reinman. This project serves as the core of the mail server part of ooTech DTES, and therefore is very central to this service.
